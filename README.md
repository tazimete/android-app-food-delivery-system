I'ts an Android app for food delivery. Clients can order from website or by this app. And a notification will be sent to food delivery boy
who will be in the radius of 12 K.M. of the client who placed the order. If he accept the order, another notification will be sent to client 
with the details of the delivery boy. And if he reject the order then app will search for another rider and will send notification to another delivery 
boy who are in 12 km radius of the client's place. Actually app makes a list of riders who are available within 12 km distance radius. If no 
delivery boy is found then client will get another notification that delivery notpossible at this time try again later. This radius of distance is dynamic as it 
can be changed from cms.
